## Standards - Views 
Before any changes are being comitted in git the developer will follow the below listed guide line.

* verify the web pages are responsive - open in mozilla and chrome both and tested in Mobile. 
Use standard plugins to resize screen resolution.


* image aspect ratio to be maintained, any image that is stretched or elongated needs to be correctly adjusted when changing the resolution of the image.


* Size of images 800 KB - 1024KB - thumb rule being all images should be within an MB in size for home page or banner and should be even smaller for other images.


* use tools to get the page load speed optimized. google page speed insight (https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)
is a good starting point. or https://tools.pingdom.com/ 
Acceptable score on google is more than 65


* Use mechanism to reduce load times in Mobile if it means to have different images bundled for WEB or Mobile view that is acceptable.
    * in Web use say ../images/__web__/banner.png while mobile can use ../images/__mobile__/banner.png


* check the readability of the web pages - this tells how complex words we have used and a general age criterion who can read this.

* the most bang for your buck are __margin__, __padding__, __line-height__, __word-spacing__, __letter-spacing__ and __text-indent__


* using __:visited __ tag to clearly differentiated already visited sites.
